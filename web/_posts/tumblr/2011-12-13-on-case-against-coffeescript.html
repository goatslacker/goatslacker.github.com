<a href="http://ryanflorence.com/2011/2012/case-against-coffeescript/">On case against coffeescript...</a><br/><p>There are basically a few arguments against using CoffeeScript and at the end of the article Ryan Florence suggests one to not use it. It basically boils down to these cases:</p>
<ul><li>Debugging is an issue</li>
<li>Verbally Readable&#160;!== Quicker Comprehension</li>
<li>One liners are horrible</li>
<li>CoffeeScript has it’s bad parts</li>
<li>Significant whitespace + Spaghetti code is bad</li>
<li>CoffeeScript will never be supported natively.</li>
</ul><h2>Debugging is an issue</h2>
<p>So yes, debugging is an issue. Hopefully this can be solved soon by  <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/source-map">SourceMap</a>.</p>
<h2>Verbally Readable does not mean Quicker Comprehension.</h2>
<p>I agree, in fact I comprehend <code>Verbally Readable !== Quicker Comprehension</code> quicker than I do the title. But the nice thing about CoffeeScript is that <strong>it’s just JavaScript</strong> so the lengthy wordy operators are <em>optional.</em></p>
<p>You could always write in CoffeeScript:</p>
<pre><code>one &amp;&amp; two &amp;&amp; three
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>one and two and three
</code></pre>
<h2>One liners are horrible</h2>
<p>Here’s an example from the blog:</p>
<pre><code>scores = (student["assignment_#{@assignment.id}"].score for own idx, student of @gradebook.students when student["assignment_#{@assignment.id}"]?.score?)
</code></pre>
<p>Right, that’s not easy to comprehend. In this particular case I don’t blame the language but the author.</p>
<p>Sure the CoffeeScript documentation touts how it turns verbose JavaScript into “nice” and “sexy” one-liners but that doesn’t mean one should abuse it.</p>
<h2>CoffeeScript has it’s bad parts</h2>
<p>So does every other language. I  think the good parts of the language outweigh the bad parts.</p>
<h2>Significant whitespace + spaghetti code is bad</h2>
<p>Spaghetti code itself is bad. I don’t care what language you write it in. It’ll always look like shit.</p>
<p>It seems like now we’re talking about preferring one type of spaghetti over another type of spaghetti — it’s still spaghetti.</p>
<h2>CoffeeScript will never be supported natively</h2>
<p>Is that really a bad thing?</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>I still believe the expressiveness and useful features that CoffeeScript provides outweighs the biggest problem which is debugging.</p>
