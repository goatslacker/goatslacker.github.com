<a href="https://github.com/goatslacker/KickAss">Multiplayer Online Game with #nodejs</a><br/><p>The game is actually a bookmarklet originally developed by Erik Anderson (erkie.github.com) which allowed you to blow up DOM nodes in a webpage. I went ahead and modified the code to pit player vs player in ultimate HTML5 canvas warfare, utilizing Socket.IO (Guillermo Rauch) and I wrote a small server app for it using NodeJS. It&#8217;s opensource, and available on github.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking to change the name so it doesn&#8217;t conflict with a hollywood flick. Any suggestions? So far I&#8217;ve got things like: CloudFighter and Node Gladiators</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also looking for help, if anyone wants to code or host it, let me know!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be adding a public server in a week or two just for testing. Stay tuned.</p>
