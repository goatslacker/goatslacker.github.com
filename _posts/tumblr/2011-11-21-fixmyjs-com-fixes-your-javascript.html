<a href="http://fixmyjs.com">Fixmyjs.com Fixes your JavaScript</a><br/><p>I built this a couple weekends ago &#8212; it&#8217;s based off of my nodejs tool jshint-autofix `npm install fixmyjs` <a href="http://github.com/goatslacker/jshint-autofix">http://github.com/goatslacker/jshint-autofix</a> which in turn sits on top of JSHint.</p>
<p>The goal is to detect errors in your code and automatically fix them while making sure your program still functions as intended. It&#8217;s a difficult goal to attain since I do have to destroy the code in some instances in order to &#8220;fix&#8221; it. This is why I have unit tests and include popular libraries such as jQuery and Backbone in the unit tests.</p>
