Hi!
Unfortunately my ex-host killed off the server and deleted the database :( I’ve made the project open-source — it’s available on github for forking or creating your own patch server: https://github.com/goatslacker/LSDJ-Patch-Book
I wouldn’t mind working on it again or fixing it up if people start using it again :)
