Multiplayer Online Game with #nodejsThe game is actually a bookmarklet originally developed by Erik Anderson (erkie.github.com) which allowed you to blow up DOM nodes in a webpage. I went ahead and modified the code to pit player vs player in ultimate HTML5 canvas warfare, utilizing Socket.IO (Guillermo Rauch) and I wrote a small server app for it using NodeJS. It’s opensource, and available on github.
I’m looking to change the name so it doesn’t conflict with a hollywood flick. Any suggestions? So far I’ve got things like: CloudFighter and Node Gladiators
I’m also looking for help, if anyone wants to code or host it, let me know!
I’ll be adding a public server in a week or two just for testing. Stay tuned.
