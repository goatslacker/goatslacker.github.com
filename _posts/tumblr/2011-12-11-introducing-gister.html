<a href="https://github.com/goatslacker/gister">Introducing gister</a><br/><p>A nodejs module for programmatic access to create, edit and retrieve gists from github.</p>
<p>There are quite a few gist libraries available from npm. Most were CLI apps to create new gists, others didn’t exactly meet my needs. So I set out to create <code>gister</code> which provides what I think is a simple API. It follows the observer pattern and uses <code>request</code> to talk to GitHub.</p>
<p><a href="http://goatslacker.github.com/gister">Read the annotated source</a> or check out <a href="https://github.com/goatslacker/gister">the code</a>.</p>
<p>Using it is really simple. Here’s how you retrieve a gist with <code>gist_id = 1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var gist = new Gist({ gist_id: 1 });
gist.on('get', function (data) {
  // do something with data
});
gist.get();
</code></pre>
<p>Creating a new gist is similar, although you’ll need to provide Gist with your GitHub username and Secret API Token which can be found in your <a href="https://github.com/account/admin">Account Settings</a></p>
<pre><code>var gist = new Gist({ username: 'goatslacker', token: 'abc123' });
gist.on('created', function (data, gist_id) {
  // gist_id is the newly created gist id
  // data is what github returns in it's reply
});
gist.create();
</code></pre>
<p>Available on npm. Install:</p>
<pre><code>npm install gister
</code></pre>
