So I had been working on this app since about February of 2009. First the idea spawned and then I wrote all the logic for the game, I hit a small roadblock with the goals I was trying to accomplish and other things came up in life so I placed this project on the back burner. A year and a couple months later I pick up the project again and I polish it up into a nice webOS application. And Palm released it shortly thereafter.
I created both paid and an ad supported free version of the game. Itâ€™s available for download via the App Catalog.
